# Note on Runtime Dependencies:
# This workflow currently uses both Bun and Node.js runtimes, which may seem redundant.
# However, this dual-runtime approach is necessary because `bun publish` does not currently
# support npm's trusted publishing feature (provenance and OIDC-based authentication) or
# my current attempts to configure it to do so have been unsuccessful.
#
# So we are falling back to `npm publish` for the actual publishing step to leverage trusted publishing.
#
# TODO: Investigate whether Bun has added support for npm trusted publishing in newer versions.
#       If support is available, we should consolidate to use only Bun runtime across the entire
#       workflow to simplify the setup and reduce maintenance overhead.
